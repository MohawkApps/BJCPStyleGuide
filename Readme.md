# BJCP Style Guide
### A [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) application brought to you by [Mohawk Apps](http://www.mohawkapps.com/).

## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`.
3. For legal reasons, we do not host the XML of all the styles here externally from the BJCP website. There's a simple `rake` task you can run that will download the file for you automatically.
	1. `rake bootstrap` to download the XML data file.
4. Run `rake` to launch the app in the simulator.

## Contributing:

1. Fork it.
2. Work on a feature branch.
3. Send me a pull request.

*I also like it when people who can't contribute [open an issue](https://github.com/markrickert/BJCPStyleGuide/issues)*
