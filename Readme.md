## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`.
3. Run `rake bootstrap` to download the XML data file.
4. Run `rake` to launch the app in the simulator.

## XML Data

For legal reasons, we do not host the XML of all the styles here on github. The BJCP [specifically asks people](http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php) not to post versions of the style guidelines anywhere else.

You are NOT authorized to copy and post these guidelines, in any form, either on the web or in print, without specific permission from the BJCP.
