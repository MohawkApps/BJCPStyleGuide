## How to run the app from source:

1. You **must** have a valid license of [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/).
2. Download the source code.
3. Open a terminal and `cd` into the directory. 
4. Run `bundle` to install dependencies.
5. Run `rake` to launch the app in the simulator.

## Opening a style from another app:

BJCPStyles implements url schemes `bjcpstyle://` and `bjcp://`. You can easily open the BJCPStyles app from Safari to automatically open a style by typing (as an example): `bjcpstyle://3B` which would launch the app and automatically open the *3B: Oktoberfest/MÃ¤rzen* style page.

### For application developers:

You can check to see if the BJCPStyles app is installed by implementing:

**Objective-C**

```objective-c
- (BOOL)isBJCPStylesInstalled {
  NSURL *bjcpStylesURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"bjcpstyle:"];
  return  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] canOpenURL:bjcpStylesURL];
}
```

**RubyMotion**

```ruby
def bjcpstyles_installed?
  bjcpstyles_url = NSURL.URLWithString "bjcpstyle:"
  UIApplication.sharedApplication.canOpenURL bjcpstyles_url
end
```

Then to actually call the app to open and go to a style:

**Objective-C**

```objective-c
- (void)openBJCPStyle(style) {
  NSURL *bjcpStylesURL = [NSURL URLWithString:[NString stringWithFormat:@"bjcpstyle://%@", style]];
  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:bjcpStylesURL];
}
```

**RubyMotion**

```ruby
def open_bjcpstyle(style)
  url = NSURL.URLWithString "bjcpstyle://#{style}"
  UIApplication.sharedApplication.openURL url
end
```

## Internationalization:

It would be great to have the style guidelines translated into other languages. If you would like to contribute a translation, check out the `/resources/en/` folder for the official SQLite database of styles, localized strings file, and content for the app.

You can copy those files into your own [internationalized folder](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/LanguageDesignations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002144-BBCEGGFF) and make translations.

At a minimum, we need the following files translated:

* `SQLite database`
* `Localized.strings`

Once you've created that folder in the `resources` directory, [send me a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)!
